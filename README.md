### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Recommendations:

After analysis, my team believe this is the best time getting into Film business. ​

We would suggest：​

1. Hiring Woody Allen as director ​

2. Adventure and family genre ​

3. Approximately 125 mins length. 


## Limitations & Next Steps

1. With more time, I would like to dig into relationship between crews, try to find a best coroperation team.

2. For advanturr and family movie, we can plot and find which month should be put on the screen.

3. Though movie business drop during pandemic, family online movie web subscribtion incress a lot. We can calculte different company gross increase rate to find whose business model is the best.
